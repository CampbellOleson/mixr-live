  "description": "mixr is a dynamic drum machine that lets artists import tracks and adjust audio playback by speeding up, slowing down, or changing the pitch of samples. Mixr allows you to loop and layer tracks that you record or import. Mixr also has a \"deck\" that allows you to map samples to keys on your keyboard and play them percussively with you track, much as you would with a drum machine.",
